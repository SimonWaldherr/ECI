# Integration Guides

This directory contains an integration guide aimed at a FSW developer integrating the external code into a CFS environment.

# Doxygen

Warning: The doxygen docs aren't very useful yet... need to add more descriptions/explanations.

Doxygen documentation can be generated for the source code using the configuration file (DoxyFile) found here. On windows, from this directory:
```
doxygen DoxyFile
```
The documentation will be output in a directory `doxy` located here.
