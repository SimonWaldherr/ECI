The Story Behind the ECI:</h1>
<p>With the rise of the core Flight Executor (cFE), a framework created by the Goddard Space Flight Center to address the growing "clone and own" strategy, comes a significant learning curve to create core Flight System (cFS) apps for spacecraft missions. The goal of the External Code Interface (ECI) was to provide a relatively simple framework to develop cFS apps compatable with the cFE without having to know the details of the internal mechanisms of the cFE. Of course, since zero cost abstractions are hard to come by, the goal of the ECI was to only introduce as much complexity as needed for getting simple apps off the ground. By providing an interface header, it's possible to integrate legacy FSW code into cFE apps without having to fully convert the source code into something compatable with the cFE.</p>
<p>The ECI framework was created to primarily support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legacy Code</li>
<li>Autogenerated Code</li>
<li>Hand-written algorithms</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_heritage"></a>
ECI's Heritage:</h1>
<p>Autogeneration of code is nothing new in the world of flight software but tools like Matlab/Simulink don't have an internal concept of the framework your project is working with. The precursor to the ECI, the Simulink Interface Layer (SIL), aimed to solve a more specific problem; How do we integrate autogenerated simulink code into the new cFS environment? After developing the SIL, the concept of integrating non-cFE oriented code into a cFE environment was generalized and turned into what we now call the ECI. The SIL/ECI have been used on a suite of past NASA missions such as LADEE, NICER, GEDI, and PACE with a continuing support into newer versions of the cFE. Since ECI was primarily developed for bringing legacy/non-cFE code into the cFS, the ECI's goal is to smooth the learning curve for cFE application development.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_howto"></a>
How to Read This Documentation:</h1>
<p>These docs are intended to provide enough information to integrate your app with the ECI and as such we've tried to preempt as many questions as possible. Since we are trying our best to provide a quick transition from external code to a working cFS app, our documentation aims to provide the shortest route to a working application. If you're not interested in learning the abstractions, feel free to start from one of our working examples and modify it to your use case. If you're the kind of person that wishes to know the ins and outs of whatever framework you're working with, we've hopefully included enough information to satiate your curiousity. In either case, we hope you find these documents informative and the ECI framework a pleasure to work with.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_requirements"></a>
ECI Integration Requirements:</h1>
<p>The barebones nature of the ECI places some restrictions on the structure of apps that can be built with the ECI. For most applications, we've noticed a subset of patterns that are already present or could be easily added to external code without changing it's function.</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure provided to ECI as a buffer, must be global.</li>
<li>The external code needs to provide a run loop to be executed on each tick of the ECI.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_components"></a>
Main Components of the ECI:</h1>
<p>As a framework intended to support the cFE, it's expected that we need to work within standard C constructs; that being the case, we provide access to ECI's behavior using a header file named <code>eci_interface.h</code> ideally written by a software developer knowledgable with the target external code. You can find more details on writing this interface header <a class="el" href="creating_eci_interface.html">here</a> or if you tend to learn better under example, we've provided two examples in the <code>/examples</code> directory in the repository.</p>
<p>The ECI was designed to support most core CFE features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>initialization, execution, and termination of application</li>
<li>input/output message management with CFE Software Bus (SB)</li>
<li>table management with CFE Table Services (TS)</li>
<li>housekeeping counter management</li>
<li>event services registration and event triggering</li>
<li>Critical Data Store (CDS) nonvolatile storage of data</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more in depth explaination of the inner workings of ECI, we've created several diagrams indicating the order of events <a class="el" href="diagrams.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="quick_start"></a>
Quick Start:</h1>
<p>For people interested in getting their feet wet with the ECI, we've provided a quick start section that covers building ECI apps with both the CFE 6.5 and 6.6 <a class="el" href="example_build.html">here</a>. This was indended as a quick introduction and avoids the implementation details of integrating an ECI app.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_change_requests"></a>
Change Requests and Community Involvement:</h1>
<p>ECI development tries to be receptive towards issues posted on the official ECI repository on GitHub. If you find yourself having trouble with something that hasn't been provided in this documentation, please consider opening an issue. The development team for ECI is relatively small and we try to make improvements as we get the opportunity but your feedback gives us a clearer picture of what our users expect from the ECI. </p>
